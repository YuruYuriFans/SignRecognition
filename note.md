# SignRecognition
COMP3419 A2 Opt 3 German Traffic Sign Recognition

## History

<!-- 40% for testing, 60% for training. -->

To do list:
<!-- - Data augmentation (done) -->
<!-- - New dataset? At night (not allowed) -->
- New model? (Shallow CNN/Mini VGG)
  - Ensemble(Adaboost)?
- target common errors?
- Generative-Adversial Network?
- How to benchmark computational cost / improvements in my report?

## Report draft

<!-- Spatial Regularization Network works better where one image corresponds to multiple labels, but does not yield significant improvements for one-label. However, in reality, if there are traffic signs that require multiple labels, this might work better than LeNET5. -->
