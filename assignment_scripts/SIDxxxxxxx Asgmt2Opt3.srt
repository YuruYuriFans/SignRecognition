1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,710
Traffic sign recognition faces a key challenge:

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,070
Balancing accuracy with computational efficiency for embedded devices.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,790
While modern networks achieve high accuracy, speed remains

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,530
under research.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,830
This study asks, can the 30-year-old

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,450
LeNet-5 still compete?

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,330
Our methodology has three parts.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,090
First, we compare four architectures on GTSRB.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,810
Second, we fine-tune LeNet-5 to maximize performance.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,130
Third, we conduct ablation studies to validate each

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,050
design choice.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,090
We use GTSRB over 50,000 images across

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,570
43 imbalanced classes.

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,810
Our metrics balance prediction quality and computational efficiency.

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,550
MiniVGG leads in accuracy at 98%, but

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:04,690
LeNet-5 delivers exceptional speed, processing 120,000 images

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,050
per second on my personal device, which is

18
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,170
four times faster than MiniVGG, with only

19
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,630
2% accuracy loss.

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,690
This demonstrates a fundamental accuracy speed tradeoff.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,580
Ablation studies validate LeNet-5's design.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,680
Data augmentation showed minimal improvement because GTSRB has

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,840
already had sufficient natural variation.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,880
Alternative kernels and activation functions dramatically degraded performance,

25
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,880
confirming that the original 5x5 kernels and RELU

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,120
are optimal for this shallow architecture.

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,260
Fine-tuning experiments with label smoothing and optimizer

28
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,100
adjustments revealed that LeNet-5 already operates near its

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,800
performance ceiling.

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,680
This validates the robustness of the original architecture.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,080
MiniVGG's deeper architecture with sequential 3x3 blocks

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,320
creates a robust feature hierarchy for complex patterns,

33
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,800
but requires 8.6x more computation.

34
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,960
LeNet-5's shallow design with 5x5 kernels minimizes overhead

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,460
while maintaining adequate capacity, enabling four times faster

36
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,060
actual inference.

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,500
So, for real-time embedded systems with limited

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,600
resources, LeNet-5 is ideal.

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,080
But for safety-critical applications with available computational

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,300
resources, MiniVGG's superior accuracy justifies the cost.

41
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,900
Current limitations include daytime-only images and ideal

42
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,740
conditions.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,960
Future work should address adverse weather, nighttime scenarios,

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,860
and real-world testing across multiple datasets.

45
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,140
Our conclusion is that LeNet-5 achieves 96%

46
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,660
accuracy at 120,000 images per second on

47
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,660
my personal devices, providing its continued relevance, while

48
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,000
MiniVGG is more accurate.

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,600
LeNet-5 is four times faster and 87%

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,660
% lower computational cost make it ideal for

51
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,540
embedded real-time applications.

52
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,300
So, the 30-year-old architecture remains remarkably

53
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,120
competitive.
